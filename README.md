# nyc-analysis# Shooting Cluster Analysis Project

This project performs clustering analysis on a dataset of shooting incidents. Using data science techniques such as data preprocessing, feature selection, and clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means ), the goal is to identify spatial or behavioral patterns in shooting data which could help inform public policy or resource allocation.

##  Files Included

- `shooting_cluster_project.csv.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing the full data analysis workflow
- `README.md` – Project overview and setup instructions (you are here)
- `requirements.txt` – Python packages required to run the notebook (optional)

##  Project Goals

- Understand geographic and/or contextual patterns in shooting incidents.
- Apply clustering algorithms to group similar incidents together.
- Visualize clusters using relevant plots and maps.
- Provide insights that could assist policymakers or researchers.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (for clustering)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing

The notebook includes:
- Cleaning null or invalid entries
- Converting and scaling features
- Visual exploration of variable distributions

## 📈 Clustering Techniques

- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)
- Silhouette Score and Elbow Method for cluster evaluation

## 🗺️ Visualization

- Scatter plots for clusters
- Geographic mapping (if coordinates are available)

## ✅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shooting-cluster-project.git
   cd shooting-cluster-project
